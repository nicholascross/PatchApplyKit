# TODO

## Mode and permission enhancements
- Capture and apply `index ...` optional mode tokens for existing files when no content change occurs.
- Support Windows-style attributes or ACL metadata (future cross-platform consideration).

## Matching robustness
- Add out-of-order hunk application guard rails and reporting when context shifts but still matches.

## Validation and diagnostics
- Surface structured warnings (not just errors) for ignored metadata lines.
- Provide human-readable diff summary after successful apply for logging/analytics.

## Tooling & API polish
- Publish API documentation and usage examples demonstrating custom filesystem adapters.
- Offer async variants of apply APIs for long-running operations.
- Add command-line wrapper target for easy manual testing.
